# Backend Execution Plan
## Decentralized Freelancer Trust Platform

**Mission:** Legalise freelancer contracts through blockchain and build lasting freelancer trust.  
**Principles:** Speed, security, scale. **Rules:** See [RULES_OF_BACKEND.md](./RULES_OF_BACKEND.md) — attach to every backend prompt.

**Created:** January 24, 2026  
**Technology:** Go microservices + PostgreSQL + Base L2  
**Where we are:** Phase 3 (Contract service) — draft/send done; user_name, public profile by user_name, and visibility (profile/projects/contracts) are done in user-service. Next: draft auto-delete, send→blockchain/email/link, client sign, wallets, submission, reputation.

---

## 1. User flow (source of truth)

This section is the canonical user journey. Backend phases and deliverables are derived from it.

### 1.1 Login / Signup → Create profile → Dashboard

1. User lands on website → **Login** or **Signup**.
2. After auth → **Create profile** (name, photo, headline, skills, location, experience, social links, role, etc.).
3. User lands on **Dashboard** with:
   - Option to **Create contract**
   - Option to **Send contract to client**
   - Option to **Save contract as draft**

**Backend:** Auth service (login/signup), User service (profile CRUD, `user_name` for public URL, public profile by user_name, visibility).  
**Status:** ✅ Done (Auth + User services; `user_name`, public profile by user_name, and visibility flags implemented).

---

### 1.2 Create contract • Save as draft • Send to client

4. **Create contract** — Freelancer fills:
   - **Project:** category, name, description, due date, amount, PRD upload (e.g. PDF URL), submission criteria.
   - **Client:** name, company, email, phone.
   - **Milestones:** initial payment, project milestones, milestone descriptions, terms & conditions.

5. **Save as draft**
   - Contract is stored only in backend; status `draft`.
   - **Rule:** Drafts are **automatically deleted after 14 days** (scheduled job).

6. **Send to client**
   - Status becomes `sent`.
   - Contract is saved in backend and, **on client sign**, also recorded on blockchain (see below).
   - **Client** (email from contract) receives an **email** about the contract.
   - **Freelancer** gets a **shareable link** to copy and send to the client personally (e.g. `ourdomain.com/contract/:id` or signed tokenised link).

**Backend:** Contract service (create/update/list/get/send/delete), draft 14-day auto-delete job, shareable contract link, notification trigger for “contract sent”.  
**Status:** ⏳ CRUD + draft + send + auto-delete + shareable link + email trigger done; **not yet:** blockchain write on sign, client view/sign (3.3+).

---

### 1.3 Client: open contract → Sign or Send for review

7. **Client** opens the contract (frontend; link from email or shared URL).

8. **Two actions:**
   - **Sign contract**
   - **Send for review** (client writes a comment; contract goes back to freelancer in **pending** state; freelancer edits and sends again).

**Backend:** Contract service — client-facing read endpoint (by token or public link), “send for review” (comment + status `pending`), “sign” (see below).  
**Status:** ❌ Not started.

---

### 1.4 Client signs: details + wallet + blockchain

9. When client clicks **Sign**:
   - **Pre-filled:** email, phone (from freelancer’s contract).
   - **Optional** (more completion = extra trust/reputation points for freelancer): company (GST number with **GST validator**), business email verification, Instagram, LinkedIn.
   - **Required:** Company address — either “Remote” or full address or **Google Maps URL**.

10. **Wallets:** Freelancer and client wallets are **created and managed by the backend**. No blockchain knowledge or manual wallets for users.

11. **On sign:** Contract is recorded on the **blockchain network** with at least: transaction id, hashed details, timestamp, deadline, amount, gas fee, and any other data needed for legal/audit. Contract status becomes **signed**.

**Backend:** Contract service (client sign payload, validation, optional GST validator), Wallet/Blockchain service (create custodial wallets, submit contract record on-chain, return tx id/hash etc.).  
**Status:** ❌ Not started.

---

### 1.5 After sign: submission → client review → reputation

12. **Freelancer submits project:**
   - One field **exactly as** the “submission criteria” defined by the freelancer in the contract.
   - One **detailed description** field.
   - On submit → **Client receives an email.**

13. **Client** can **Accept** or **Ask for revision**. Revisions loop until client accepts.

14. **Reputation** for that contract is computed from:
   - Client review (rating/feedback),
   - Whether the work was submitted before or after the deadline,
   - Whether it was accepted or not,
   - Other agreed factors.

15. **Contract is saved to the freelancer’s user profile** with all required details and linked for display and reputation.

**Backend:** Contract service (submission CRUD, accept/revision), Notification (email on submit), Reputation service (per-contract score, persisted and later synced to chain if planned). User service: link contract to profile, store visibility and summary.  
**Status:** ❌ Not started.

---

### 1.6 Public profile and visibility

16. **Freelancer** can choose:
   - Which **contracts** to show on the public profile,
   - Which **details** of each contract to show,
   - Which **profile** and **project** information is visible.

17. **Unique public profile URL:** `ourdomain.com/user_name` — `user_name` is set when creating/editing profile and must be unique.

**Backend:** User service — `user_name` (unique), visibility flags for profile / projects / contracts and per-contract visibility, public profile API by `user_name`.  
**Status:** ✅ Done for profile/projects/contracts visibility and public-by-username API; per-contract visibility and contract section on public profile to be added when contract data is linked (Phase 4).

## 3. Where we are now (summary)

| Area | Done | Next |
|------|------|------|
| **Auth** | Register, login, refresh, OAuth, JWT | — |
| **User** | Profile CRUD, skills, projects, search | `user_name`, public profile, visibility |
| **Contract** | Create/update/list/get, draft, send, delete | Draft 14-day delete; shareable link; email on send; client view/sign/review; wallets; blockchain on sign |
| **Submission & review** | — | Submission API, accept/revision, emails |
| **Reputation** | — | Per-contract score, persist, optionally on-chain |
| **Profile linkage** | — | Contract on profile, visibility, public `user_name` |

**Immediate next steps (in order):**

1. **Draft auto-delete:** Job that deletes contracts in `draft` older than 14 days.
2. **Send experience:** Shareable contract link; trigger “contract sent” email to client.
3. **Client flow:** View by link, sign (with required/optional fields), send for review.
4. **Wallets + blockchain:** Create freelancer/client wallets; on client sign, write contract to chain and save tx id/hash etc.
5. **Submission and review:** Submit work (criteria + detailed desc), client accept/revision, emails.
6. **Reputation:** Per-contract score from review/deadline/acceptance; store and optionally expose on profile.
7. **Profile:** `user_name`, public profile URL, visibility for profile/projects/contracts.

---

## 4. Technology and layout (aligned with RULES_OF_BACKEND)

- **Stack:** Go, Chi, PostgreSQL (shared `freelancer_platform`), GORM. JWT validated with same secret as auth.
- **Layout per service:** `cmd/server`, `internal/{config,domain,dto,handler,middleware,repository,service}`. See [RULES_OF_BACKEND.md](./RULES_OF_BACKEND.md).
- **DB:** Auth, user, contract (and later reputation, etc.) use the same PostgreSQL instance unless the plan explicitly splits them.
